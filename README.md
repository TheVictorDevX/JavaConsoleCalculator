# Simple Calculator in Java

## Description

This is a basic command-line calculator application implemented in Java. It allows users to perform fundamental arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The application prioritizes user experience by implementing robust input validation, ensuring that the program continues to prompt for correct input until valid numbers and operators are provided.

## Features

* **Basic Arithmetic Operations:** Supports addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (\*), and division (/).
* **Input Validation:**
    * Checks if the entered numbers are valid numerical inputs.
    * Validates if the entered operator is one of the supported operations.
    * Handles division by zero errors.
* **Continuous Input:** The application will keep prompting the user for each input (first number, operator, second number) until a valid entry is provided.

## Usage

Once the application is running, you will be prompted to enter the following information in order:

1.  **Enter the first number:** Type a number (you can include decimals) and press Enter. The program will keep asking until a valid number is entered.
2.  **Enter the operator (+, -, *, /):** Type one of the supported operators and press Enter. The program will keep asking until a valid operator is entered.
3.  **Enter the second number:** Type another number (you can include decimals) and press Enter. The program will keep asking until a valid number is entered.

After you have entered all three inputs correctly, the calculator will display the result of the operation. The program will then terminate.
